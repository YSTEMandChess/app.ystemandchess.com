                    Y STEM and Chess Inc. (YSC) is focused on resolving two 
                    current social problems, by providing a unique 21st 
                    Century methodology to learning called “Mastery.” The 
                    first focus is on our society’s unfulfilled need for students
                    with a firm learning foundation to pursue a life in the world 
                    of STEM. The second and the primary focus of YSC is 
                    fulfilling those needs, by working with the children of our 
                    socially and economically underserved population, to 
                    introduce and engage them in the world of STEM. The goal 
                    is to provide students from this group the skills, 
                    knowledge, and opportunity to enter these career paths 
                    and assist in solving the critical shortage of STEM-skilled
                    citizens.

                    Our focus is on schools with a large percentage of 
                    students qualifying for free or reduced-cost lunch 
                    programs or that focus on the “at risk” student 
                    population. They are the “outliers” of our traditional
                    education system both socially and economically. 
                    Students of this group are often rebellious, not 
                    because they are unable to learn but they respond to 
                    different learning approaches. The schools 
                    understand this, and it's why they are looking for
                    alternative solutions to fulfill their “at risk” student 
                    needs.
