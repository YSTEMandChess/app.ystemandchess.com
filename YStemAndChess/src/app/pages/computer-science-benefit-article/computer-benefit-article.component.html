            <p>Computer science is a quickly growing field as technology becomes more and more
                ingrained in everyday life. Studying computer science lets students go into specialized careers
                and fields within STEM, and it also provides useful skills for many other jobs. With more work
                going remote and more jobs being automated, students will need to have digital skills for both in
                and out of the workplace.

            <p> Computer science has become fundamental to our lives, from the smartphones in our
                pockets to the computer you are reading this on. Learning more about how programming works
                and how apps are created, among the other topics of computer science, helps students understand
                the world as it is around them and make more informed choices. Skills such as online research,
                data analysis, and web programming are also becoming increasingly important and valuable.
                Learning about computer science will prepare students for their future.

            <p>While math is a challenging subject, it provides the foundation for many potential careers and is
                essential for pursuing STEM related fields. Even outside of STEM, fields such as economics demand
                an understanding of math. It also helps students learn to keep track of personal finances, as being
                good with numbers is a valuable skill for balancing checkbooks and making investments. Thus, it is
                worthwhile to ensure your student has good foundational skills in mathematics.

            <p>  From an economic perspective, computer science is worthwhile and profitable to study.
                As this <span style="color: #5584EC;">article</span> says, eight percent of students graduating from STEM are in computer science, but
                58 percent of new jobs in STEM are in computer science. This makes it a promising field for
                young graduates to pursue. In terms of salary, a computer scientist can be expected to earn the
                national average salary of $99,050 according to this <span style="color: #5584EC;">article</span>. The same article also adds that many
                programmers can expect to work remotely, and that about half of all programmers work remotely
                for a few days each month. This gives students going into computer science more options for
                jobs, as location is less of a problem than in other fields. Computer science opens up
                opportunities for students to explore and earn a living.

            <p> Tutoring for students in computer science can make a great difference. Starting early
                gives students an advantage in understanding programming. Itâ€™s especially important for students
                going into college to study computer science, as other students may already have some
                background or education in the field, as this <span style="color: #5584EC;">article</span> notes. Providing support to underserved
                students is also important, as minority students and women can face unique challenges in STEM
                and computer science. As stated <span style="color: #5584EC;">here</span>, women earn only eighteen percent of computer science degrees and Black and Latino students receive only twenty-two percent of college degrees in computer science. We need to reach out to these young and underserved students to help
                encourage and support them to learn and study computer science.
