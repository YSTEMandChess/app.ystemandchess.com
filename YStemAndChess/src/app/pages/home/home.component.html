                <p>Y STEM and Chess Inc. (YSC) is focused on resolving two 
                    current social problems, by providing a unique 21st Century 
                    methodology to learning called “Mastery.” The first focus is 
                    on our society’s unfulfilled need for students with a firm 
                    learning foundation to pursue a life in the world of STEM. 
                    The second and the primary focus of YSC is fulfilling those 
                    needs, by working with the children of our socially and 
                    economically underserved population, to introduce and 
                    engage them in the world of STEM.</p>

                    Our current education system was created to satisfy the 
                    needs of an Industrial Age not those of the 21st Century. 
                    Our society from the latter part of the 1800s to mid-1960s 
                    focused on educating everyone to meet the literacy 
                    requirements in reading, writing, and math. The problem we 
                    face as a society is that our legacy education systems no 
                    longer fit the individual learning needs and haven’t since the 
                    1960s that don’t include computers. Y STEM and Chess 
                    Inc. is a 501C3 organization formed to provide a solution to 
                    this problem with a focus on those disenfranchised 
                    children in our society that have been written off because 
                    of social and economic factors. Y STEM and Chess Inc was 
                    started by someone who was classified as not “educatable” 
                    by the system, but thanks to the determination of he and 
                    his family, achieved academic success with a BA in 
                    Philosophy and MS degree in Cybersecurity. He was not 
                    considered “educatable” above a 3rd or 4th-grade level by 
                    the school system. When forming the organization, the 
                    founder also recruited people with experience to solve the 
                    problem to help develop the YSC learning program. The first 
                    is a public school math teacher with over 30 years of 
                    experience in low income areas.
