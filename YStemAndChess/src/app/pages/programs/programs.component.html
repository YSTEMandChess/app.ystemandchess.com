                <h3>Why Chess</h3>
                <p>
                    The reason we start with is that Chess is because it teaches children to start 
                    thinking like STEM professionals. We can slowly start to build the soft skills 
                    that our students will need to be successful in the long term. The ten reasons 
                    why Chess is important to the education of our youth.

                    The development of these fundamental skills required to be successful in any STEM 
                    discipline. A chess match requires creative problem-solving on the fly because your 
                    opponent is constantly changing the parameters. In order to be good programmers and STEM 
                    professionals, our students have to have a strong command of our creative side of our brains 
                    and also be able to problem solve to help reach a solution that the program wishes to solve. 
                    The problem is how to quickly checkmate the king while avoiding a checkmate from your opponent. 
                    This constant struggle forces players to think fast while implementing their strategy much like 
                    any STEM job. Health Fitness Revolution.

                        graduate with a STEM degree we could break the 
                        cycle of poverty in one generation. The founders 
                        were tired of help being promised to help every

                        helping our students help themselves. That is
