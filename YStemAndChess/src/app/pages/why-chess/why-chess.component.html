                        The development of these fundamental skills required to be successful in any STEM 
                        discipline. A chess match requires creative problem-solving on the fly because your 
                        opponent is constantly changing the parameters. In order to be good programmers and STEM 
                        professionals, our students have to have a strong command of our creative side of our brains 
                        and also be able to problem solve to help reach a solution that the program wishes to solve. 
                        The problem is how to quickly checkmate the king while avoiding a checkmate from your opponent. 
                        This constant struggle forces players to think fast while implementing their strategy much like 
                        any STEM job. Health Fitness Revolution.
